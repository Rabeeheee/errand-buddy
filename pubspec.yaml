# The following line prevents the package from being accidentally published to
# pub.dev using `flutter pub publish`. This is preferred for private packages.
publish_to: 'none' # Remove this line if you wish to publish to pub.dev

# The following defines the version and build number for your application.
# A version number is three numbers separated by dots, like 1.2.43
# followed by an optional build number separated by a +.
# Both the version and the builder number may be overridden in flutter
# build by specifying --build-name and --build-number, respectively.
# In Android, build-name is used as versionName while build-number used as versionCode.
# Read more about Android versioning at https://developer.android.com/studio/publish/versioning
# In iOS, build-name is used as CFBundleShortVersionString while build-number is used as CFBundleVersion.
# Read more about iOS versioning at
# https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/General/Reference/InfoPlistKeyReference/Articles/CoreFoundationKeys.html
# In Windows, build-name is used as the major, minor, and patch parts
# of the product and file versions while build-number is used as the build suffix.

# Dependencies specify other packages that your package needs in order to work.
# To automatically upgrade your package dependencies to the latest versions
# consider running `flutter pub upgrade --major-versions`. Alternatively,
# dependencies can be manually updated by changing the version numbers below to
# the latest version available on pub.dev. To see which dependencies have newer
# versions available, run `flutter pub outdated`.

  # The following adds the Cupertino Icons font to your application.
  # Use with the CupertinoIcons class for iOS style icons.

  # To let users sign up / log in securely (with email, Google, etc.) — so each user can have their own data and tasks.
  firebase_core: ^3.15.1
  # It connects your Flutter app to Firebase services like Firestore and Auth — works as the bridge.
  equatable: ^2.0.7
  # To compare objects easily (like two tasks) by value instead of memory — helps in BLoC and state updates.
  dartz: ^0.10.1
  # To handle errors and optional data cleanly (like saying: “get tasks might fail, so let’s handle both success and failure properly”).
  injectable: ^2.5.0
  # To auto-generate code for dependency injection, keeping your project clean, testable, and easy to change later.
  get_it: ^8.0.3
  # Works like a global box: anywhere in your app, you can say “give me my TaskRepository” without passing it manually.
  bloc: ^9.0.0
  # Helps you control app logic and separate UI from business logic (ex: load tasks, filter tasks, update tasks).
  go_router: ^16.0.0
  # To move between pages/screens (like Home → Task Details → Escalation Page) with simple route configs.
  intl: ^0.20.2
  # To format dates (“Due today”, “2025-07-07”) and times in user-friendly ways.
  cloud_firestore: ^5.6.11
  # To store and read your app data (tasks, members, escalation logs) from Google’s cloud database in real time.
  flutter_bloc: ^9.1.1

  internet_connection_checker: ^3.0.1
  # To check if the user’s device is online or offline and show messages like “No internet connection”.
  google_fonts: ^6.2.1
  # To use nicer fonts (e.g., Plus Jakarta Sans) instead of default system fonts so your app looks modern.
  shared_preferences: ^2.5.3
  # To save small data locally (like user’s theme, last selected assignee, or onboarding seen flag).
  iconify_flutter: ^0.0.7

  # The "flutter_lints" package below contains a set of recommended lints to
  # encourage good coding practices. The lint set provided by the package is
  # activated in the `analysis_options.yaml` file located at the root of your
  # package. See that file for information about deactivating specific lint
  # rules and activating additional ones.
  flutter_lints: ^5.0.0

  # The following line ensures that the Material Icons font is
  # included with your application, so that you can use the icons in
  # the material Icons class.
  uses-material-design: true

  # To add assets to your application, add an assets section, like this:
  assets:
    - assets/avatar/
    - assets/images/
    - assets/logo/

  # An image asset can refer to one or more resolution-specific "variants", see
  # https://flutter.dev/to/resolution-aware-images

  # For details regarding adding assets from package dependencies, see
  # https://flutter.dev/to/asset-from-package

  # To add custom fonts to your application, add a fonts section here,
  # in this "flutter" section. Each entry in this list should have a
  # "family" key with the font family name, and a "fonts" key with a
  # list giving the asset and other descriptors for the font. For
  # example:
  # fonts:
  #   - family: Schyler
  #     fonts:
  #       - asset: fonts/Schyler-Regular.ttf
  #       - asset: fonts/Schyler-Italic.ttf
  #         style: italic
  #   - family: Trajan Pro
  #     fonts:
  #       - asset: fonts/TrajanPro.ttf
  #       - asset: fonts/TrajanPro_Bold.ttf
  #         weight: 700
  #
  # For details regarding fonts from package dependencies,
